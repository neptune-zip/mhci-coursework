# Mobile HCI Coursework

## Kyle Neil - [2718763N](mailto:2718763n@student.gla.ac.uk)

This is my repository for my Mobile HCI coursework for the University of Glasgow, my full name and student number are above.

## Information

This project is based upon Lab 3 of the course, however in the end will have some significant changes to the code and interaction techniques used. The aim is to remove the functionality of using the device's gyroscope to move the camera, as well as removing the hover-to-click interaction. Instead, I will implement a control stick to move then an "accept" button to interact with the highlighted button, as well as potentially changing the scenario, functionality of the basket, and feedback methods used. Full details can be found in my final report of the coursework. Details mentioned here may not be final, only what is mentioned in my report, and the actual source code from this repository is intended to be part of my submission.

## Glitch

This project is intended to stay in sync with Glitch, which will host the application.
