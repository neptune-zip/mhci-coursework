## Kyle Neil - [2718763N](mailto:2718763n@student.gla.ac.uk)

This is my repository for my Mobile HCI coursework for the University of Glasgow, my full name and student number are above.

## Information

This project uses react to implement a control stick to move a cursor over buttons which list various pizza toppings. When hovering over a button a message box will appear with further details. Pizza toppings can be added or removed from the order using buttons that appear when the topping is hovered over. When finished, the view pizza button can be hovered over, and the order can be placed or cleared. Full details can be found in my final report of the coursework. Details mentioned here may not be final, only what is mentioned in my report, and the actual source code from this repository is intended to be part of my submission.

## Running the code

Please cd into the mhci-coursework folder and use `npm install` to download dependencies. NodeJS is required. Run the development server using  `npx vite --host`.
